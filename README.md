This is a portfolio project on customer segmentation of mall customers using an unsupervised machine learning algorithm in the form of clustering.

The problem statement is to understand the target customers for the marketing team to plan a campaign strategy. The context is to identify the most important shopping groups based on income, age, and the mall's shopping score with a label for each.
The objective is to divide the target market into approachable groups and also, create subsets of a mall market based on demographics behavorial criteria to better understand the target for marketing activities.

The approach to this project is to perform an exploratory data analysis to gain insight of the overall mall market size, apply KMeans Clustering Algorithm to create segments,use summary statistics on the clusters, and visualize the segmentations.
